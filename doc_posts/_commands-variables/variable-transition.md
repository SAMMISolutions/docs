Transitions a variable (numbers only) from a starting value to a final value over a given duration.\
This command can act as a timer to trigger other commands or buttons.\
For example, if you set the start value to 10, final value to 0 and duration to 10000ms (=10 seconds), it will decrease the value by 1 every second and reach 0 after exactly 10 seconds.

{% include alert.html text="Variable will stop transitioning if the button it was triggered with is cleared." type="warning" %}
