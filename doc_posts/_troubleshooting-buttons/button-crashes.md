title: Button crashes

SAMMI's crash screen will show you which button and command caused the crash:

{% include image.html w="75" src="/assets/images/troubleshooting-buttons/btnCrash.png" alt="Crash error example" external="true" %}

The crash log tells you which command crashed SAMMI, but be aware that the error could have been made in a command that executed earlier! Use that information (and what the actual error says) to troubleshoot using the tips in the next section.
