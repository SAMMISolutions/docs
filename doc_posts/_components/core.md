- **Automatically check for new updates**: When enabled, SAMMI will notify you of available updates upon launch, with an option to postpone reminders for a few days.

<td style="border:none" markdown="1">

- **Button ID** - your unique Button ID, used in various commands (such as Trigger button) and to store all your button variables. It's encouraged to give all your buttons unique IDs. 
- **Group ID** - you can group up your buttons by assigning them the same group ID. This will automatically create a queue for your buttons and prevent them from triggering at the same time.
- **Allow Queue** - if there is another trigger event while the button is still active (for example if you get two subscribers at the same time), it will place it in the queue and reactivate the button as soon as it's ready again. Does not apply if Button Overlap option is on.
- **Allow Button Overlap** - allow multiple instances of the same button to happen at the same time
- **Local Variable Persist**
   - checked - button variables will be accessible even after the button has finished. If Allow Button Overlap is enabled, all button executions will share the same variables.   
   - unchecked - button variables will be accessible only when the button is running and only inside their own button. Other buttons cannot access them even if the button is currently running. If Allow Button Overlap is enabled, unique variables will be created for each button execution and will never be shared.
- **Press type** 
   - Normal Press - single button press
   - Drag Press - the button will trigger if dragged over. You can add either a single or multiple drag press (activates if it's dragged over again). Useful for creating your own volume buttons!

#### Edit Triggers
You can right click on a button or press `CTRL + double click` to add a trigger.
Add various triggers to your button to get automatically executed when a specific event happens. For example, you can trigger your button every time you get a new follower or someone types `!hello` in your chat.  

Learn more about specific triggers in our [**Triggers**]({{ "triggers/introduction" | relative_url }}) section.

#### Edit Commands
When you right click-Edit commands or double click on your button and press **+**, you can start adding commands to execute when the button is pressed.  

Button commands have their own specific rules that you need to follow, read more about them in our [Commands-Introduction]({{ "commands/introduction" | relative_url }})  section. 
   
Once you're done with adding commands, you can now run the button directly from the commands window - no more having to save back to the main screen and testing via a chat command or pressing the button on the deck!
{% include alert.html text="Please be aware that any commands that involve wildcards or pulling info from the trigger may not work as intended if tested this way - for best results, test the same way you intend for it to be used." type="info" %} 

See the list of all available commands in the **Commands** section.  

#### Edit Release Commands
Program your button to perform specific actions when released. **The release action only happens if the button is pressed from your SAMMI Deck or hotkey**. You can add as many commands as you want.

#### Edit Init Variables
Initial variables the button will have when initiated. It prevents persistent buttons from crashing. Must be in [JSON format](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp).

#### Copy Button
Copy a button and insert it elsewhere in your decks. All buttons have unique IDs. A new copied button will have a different ID from the original one. Can also be done by selecting the button and pressing Ctrl+C, with Ctrl+V to paste it in a selected empty spot.

{% include video.html w="75" src="copy-button.mp4" alt="Copying and pasting a button" %}
