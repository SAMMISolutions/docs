LioranBoard is a closed source app made in GameMaker Studio which has become one of the most popular and customizable OBS Stream Decks.\
The main application was developed in 09/2019 by Lioran, but it was very different from LioranBoard that we know now.

      <q>LioranBoard was never planned. It was just a bunch of code for myself that triggered sound effect based on numpad presses.</q>

Lioran started adding more features and commands every update, essentially inventing his own programming language and making LioranBoard user friendly and available for everyone to benefit from.
