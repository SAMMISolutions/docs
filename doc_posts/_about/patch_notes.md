## SAMMI 2022.5.3:

#### New Features:

- Added YouTube Ad Break command [Christina]
  - allows you to insert a cuepoint into a live broadcast which might trigger an ad break
- Added Username to Twitch Chat and Twitch Channel Points triggers [Christina]
  - You can now trigger a button only when a specified user sends a chat message or redeems a channel point reward
  - Leave blank or * to accept all users
  - Must be an exact match, but is case insensitive
  - Does not accept partial names with wildcards, such as w* for any names beginning with w
- New Language: Dutch [Marble127]

#### Improvements:

- Added more characters for the Nunito font to SAMMI, including Cyrillic. [Silverlink]
- Added Triggering Button ID to "Trigger Pull Data" when triggering a button from another button. [Silverlink]
- Added Extra information when linking twitch account depending on what button you have pressed. [Silverlink]
  - SAMMI will now save if you have pressed Streamer, Bot or Custom scopes button.
- Keyboard keys detection has been reworked so now it correctly assigns special symbols in Keyboard commands and Hoykey Trigger. If you previously used any special characters (comma, quotes, brackets, etc.) in one of the mentioned commands/trigger, they will have to be readded after updating. [Sebas]
  - Special symbols are not shown in the dropdown until they are used the first time, but they still work if you press the key in your keyboard.
  - These keys shouldn't be used if you plan to share your button, as they can change in a different keyboard.
 
#### UI Changes:

- Re-enabled Bot scopes buttons for when linking your twitch account(s)
  - For now they have the same scopes as streamer scopes (This will be changed in the future)

#### Bug Fixes:

- Buffer: Hash SHA1 command now functions properly [Christina]
- Send OBS request now parses true/false correctly [Roadie]
- Improper usage of buffer commands no longer causes SAMMI to crash [Christina]
  - instead you will get a yellow alert (i.e. "Buffer does not exist", "Trying to read outside the buffer", etc.)

#### Known Bugs:

- DST (aka Summer Time) is not taken into account in Date/Time. A workaround is to substract 1 until it's fixed.

<hr>

## SAMMI 2022.5.2 

#### Improvements:

- Added alerts in Object to INI command when it fails. [Sebas]
- The settings.ini file is now protected and can't be edited with commands to avoid malicious commands in shared buttons/decks. [Sebas]
- Improved how the erros are detected whenever your decks in SAMMI are loaded [Christina]
  - If SAMMI detects your deck file has been corrupted, it will now create a new 'decks_data_corrupted.json' file to prevent it
    from being overridden, and allows you to manually repair it or share it with our dev team, while continuing to work in SAMMI.

#### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a crash when using INI to Object in an empty INI file. [Sebas]
- Fixed a bug that won't delete keys and sections when using Object to INI. [Sebas]

#### Known Bugs:

- DST (aka Summer Time) is not taken into account in Date/Time. A workaround is to substract 1 until it's fixed.
- Some Twitch commands are using Bot Scopes instead of Streamer Scopes, so we've disabled Bot Scopes temporarily.
  - Meanwhile, please revoke your Bot token and use Streamer Scopes for all accounts.

<hr>

## SAMMI 2022.5.1 

#### New Features:

- When creating an extension command from Bridge, extension boxes can now be also decks, passwords and other types. [Christina]
- Added the "sqrt" operation to commands like Set Local Variable to get the square root of a number [wolbee]

#### Improvements:

- When creating an extension command from Bridge, you can now choose whether you want it to send its data to Bridge (which is how it normally works) 
or send it as an extension trigger within SAMMI instead (without going through Bridge) when the user uses the Extension command.  [Christina]
  - Extremely helpful if you have one central button acting as a function and want to provide your users with a friendly interface to trigger it from within SAMMI.   
  - Works the same as Send Extension Triggers, except you can use custom boxes.
- When checking for updates, you will no longer get a yellow alert that your Bridge file doesn't match its cloud counterpart, 
as this is expected as soon as any extensions are installed. [Christina]
 
#### UI Changes:

- "Search" label is not shown anymore in Hotkey Trigger dropdown. [Sebas]
- Send OBS Request command now has a button to open the OBS websocket docs page [wolbee]
  - it works off the protocol for the OBS Connection specified in the command.
  - if the OBS Connection box contains a variable, it will default to ws5 docs.

- Fixed a crash that happens when the parent object/array is deleted while using a wait until variable exists/is command [Christina]
- Improved internal WS5 stability [Roadie]
- Fixed a bug that sometimes would incorrectly assign timezones in Date/Time commands and make some commands to crash [Sebas]
- Fixed a visual bug that will shown incorrect hotkeys in Hotkey Triggers [Sebas]
- Fixed a bug where using sin/cos/tan/log10 on an array would overwrite the array [wolbee]

#### Known Bugs:

- DST (aka Summer Time) is not taken into account in Date/Time. A workaround is to substract 1 until we fix it.
- Some Twitch commands are using Bot Scopes instead of Streamer Scopes, so we've disabled Bot Scopes temporarily.
  - Meanwhile, please revoke your Bot token and use Streamer Scopes for all accounts.

- Changed how users get their Twitch Auth Tokens. We now have 2 default flavors called Streamer and Bot. Streamer has almost all scopes that are available except the scopes we don't deem necessary like Stream Key. We don't need that! Bot just has the minimum requirements to listen to certain events and do moderator related stuff. There is also advanced scopes available in dev mode and that the classic scope selector but we don't advice users to use it. [Silverlink]
- Faces are now randomized in the about screen [Silverlink]
- Bridge and extensions [Christina]: 
  - Added [extension_version] you can use in your .sef files. In the near future, Bridge will contain an automatic Version Checker for all installed extensions, so we recommend adding this section to all your extensions now (this will not break installing the extensions in any old SAMMI versions).
