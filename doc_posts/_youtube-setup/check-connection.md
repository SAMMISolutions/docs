After linking your account and editing the INIT button with your refresh token, reload your Transmitter.\
The status (both in your Transmitter in YouTube Live tab and your Stream Deck) should change from `Disconnected` to `Ready`. This means your refresh token is correct and LioranBoard is ready to start listening to events once your stream goes live.\
Once the status is `Ready`, the following commands become available: **List Categories, Get My Channel Stats, Get Member Info, Get Subscriber Status**.
