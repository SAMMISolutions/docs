Changes settings of a source. Not to be confused with item transform settings.\
Easy way to see your current source's settings is to use the **Check Settings button** - after filling out the Source Name box, you will get a pop-up showing the source's settings, excluding any still at default values.

Use [JSON string validator](https://jsonlint.com/) if you want to make sure your formatting is correct.
