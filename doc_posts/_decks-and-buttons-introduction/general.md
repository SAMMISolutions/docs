Decks and Buttons are a core concept you need to be familiar with before creating anything in SAMMI.

With SAMMI Core (the main component of SAMMI), you create `Buttons` which contain instructions known as `Commands` for the program to execute via a super easy drag-and-drop block based programming system. Buttons can be customized with colors, graphics, and more, which are then placed freely in a `Deck`, which houses multiple buttons. Buttons can be triggered manually by clicking them or touching them from a mobile device via a Deck App, or they can be triggered automatically from events such as Twitch subscriptions, raids, OBS Scene Changes, and even community-made extensions allowing users to integrate their own services into the SAMMI ecosystem.

That is the most straightforward premise of how SAMMI operates! You can see that Decks and Buttons play a crucial role for how you experience SAMMI, with Commands being even more important, so there is a dedicated section for that later on.

You can think of Decks like folders to contain your Buttons.

And you can think of Buttons, like bundles of instructions to carry out a task, filled with commands that tell it what to do.
