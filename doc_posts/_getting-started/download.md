### Prerequisites

**OBS Studio**     
SAMMI Core is compatible with OBS Studio. Other streaming software, such as Streamlabs OBS, is not currently supported.

**OBS Websocket**       
OBS Websocket enables communication between SAMMI Core and OBS Studio.

OBS Studio 28 and higher come with OBS Websocket 5.0 pre-installed, so there is no need to install it separately.

SAMMI is compatible with OBS Websocket versions 5.0 and 4.9. However, we highly recommend using OBS Websocket 5.0 with OBS Studio versions 28 and above.

While OBS Websocket 5.0 is preferred, there may be specific cases where OBS Websocket 4.9 is still needed, such as when using certain outdated plugins that have not yet been updated for compatibility with OBS Websocket 5.0. For users who need to maintain compatibility with OBS Websocket 4.9, OBS Studio 28 and above supports the installation of the OBS Websocket 4.9.1-compat plugin, which can be downloaded from the OBS Websocket GitHub.
