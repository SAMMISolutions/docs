### How to Download SAMMI

When you download SAMMI, the package includes SAMMI Core, SAMMI Bridge, SAMMI Panel, and SAMMI Voice.

Please note that SAMMI Core is fully supported on Windows 10 and later versions.  

While it may be possible to run SAMMI on Linux and macOS using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), we cannot guarantee full functionality and do not offer technical support for this setup. If you choose to use Wine, ensure that it is configured to emulate Windows 10 or later.

### Required Software

**OBS Studio**     
SAMMI Core is compatible with OBS Studio. Other streaming software, such as Streamlabs OBS, is not currently supported.

**OBS Websocket**       
OBS Websocket enables communication between SAMMI Core and OBS Studio. SAMMI is compatible with OBS Websocket versions 5.0 and 4.9. However, we highly recommend using OBS Websocket 5.0 with OBS Studio versions 28 and 29, as it is the latest version.  

OBS Studio 28 and higher come with OBS Websocket 5.0 pre-installed, so there is no need to install it separately.  

While OBS Websocket 5.0 is preferred, there may be specific cases where OBS Websocket 4.9 is still needed, such as when using certain outdated plugins that have not yet been updated for compatibility with OBS Websocket 5.0. For users who need to maintain compatibility with OBS Websocket 4.9, OBS Studio 28 and above supports the installation of the OBS Websocket 4.9.1-compat plugin, which can be downloaded from the OBS Websocket GitHub.
