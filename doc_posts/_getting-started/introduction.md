<p class="lb-lead">SAMMI is a versatile Streaming Assistant designed to enhance interactivity between streamers and their <b>Twitch</b> and <b>YouTube Live</b> audiences.</p>

SAMMI is fully compatible with [OBS Websocket](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/), allowing you to remotely control [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).
