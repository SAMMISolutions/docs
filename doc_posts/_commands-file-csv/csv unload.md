Unloads a CSV that was previously loaded or created from the buffer space within SAMMI. This does NOT delete the CSV file from where it is saved to. A CSV file that has been loaded cannot be loaded again unless the CSV has been unloaded from the buffer space. To delete the CSV file itself use 'File: Delete File'
